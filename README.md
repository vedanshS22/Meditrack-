# MediTrack

MediTrack is a modular, object-oriented Clinic &amp; Appointment Management System implemented in Core Java.

This project demonstrates:

- Core and advanced OOP (encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, cloning, immutability)
- Collections, generics, equals/hashCode, comparators
- Exception handling with custom exceptions
- File I/O, CSV parsing, and (optional) serialization
- Basic concurrency utilities
- Design patterns (Singleton, Strategy, etc.)
- Java 8+ streams and lambdas

The source code lives under `src/main/java/com/airtribe/meditrack`, and a simple manual `TestRunner` is under `src/test/java`.

For environment setup and JVM internals, see `docs/Setup_Instructions.md` and `docs/JVM_Report.md`.
